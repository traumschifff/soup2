    <h2>Mantis Dance</h2>

    <hr>

    <p>„Mantis Dance“ is a film that oscillates between states of embodied Femme Fatale and hyper sexual Subjectivity as well as dangerous, dreadful, hungry Mantis - a homicidal and cannibalistic creation. 
    </p>
    <p>Through audio snippets of descriptions of the mating habit of Mantises as well as pieces of Samirah Raheems iconic interview at a Slut Walk from 2017 the video touches upon womanhood, femininity, sexuality, legislation and autonomy of the female body, sensuality, brutality, the grotesque and the ugly. It tries to manoeuvre along a thing line of the mentioned categories above while simultaneously transgressing those in sometimes contradictory ways. By that “Mantis Dance” is not working as enforcement of certain categories but tries to blur the lines between them.
    </p>
    <p>The work is structured in different episodes of fabulated Fantasy and (auto-)ethnographic documentary, which is adding a meta level to the multilayered perspectives on erotic dancing. This enhances the attempts of reclaiming the female body and identity, creating a sexy, desirable yet still complex and holistic approach of a subjects mind. Through the combination of the curated audio snippets with the visuals displayed “Mantis Dance” humorously provokes alternative ways of thinking of gender and sex by structuring a human utopia.
